Training pipeline guideline:
- Feature Engineering:
	- explicit features 
		(day, week, dow, days since prior transaction, month, quarter, year, location);
	- customer features 
		(total number of items bought, unique number of categories bought, total number of prior orders, unique number of orders, avg days since prior transaction, avg basket size, last basket size, mode, 1st quartil, median and 3rd quartil of dow, number of orders with new categories never bought before, number of categories only bought once);
	- category features 
		(total number of categories bought, total number of reorders for the category, number of customers who bought a category, number of customers who bought only one time, mode 1st quartil median 3rd quartil of dow for a category);
	- customer-category features
		(total number of orders with a category for a customer, reordered categories by a customer, avg days since a customer bought from a category, days since a customer bought from a category, mode 1st quartil median and 3rd quartil of dow of a customer for a category).


Apply feature selection before tensor flow and compare the results.

- Normalization: min-max normalization vs standardization (normal distribution approach)
- Log transformation

- Label: 1 if a customer bought a category in the last x months else 0

- Training-validation-test split

- Training models, with feature selection (tensorflow evaluates importance of features for predicting the target variable) and hyperparameter tuning. Check if features with high computational cost actually improve well the modelâ€™s predictability power.
