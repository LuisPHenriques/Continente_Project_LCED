Training pipeline guideline:
- Feature Engineering:

# All the variables are time framed #

	- explicit features 
		day - day of the month - V; 
		week -  number of the week (1-52) V;
		dow - day of the week (0-6) V; 
		month -  month of the year (1-12) V; 
		quarter - quarter of the year (1-4) V; 
		year - calendar year (20**) V;
		location - name of the city, zip code, etc V;
		
	- customer features 
		total number of purchases - total number of times a customer made a purchase V;
		unique number of categories bought - distinct number of categories bought by a customer V;
		total number of prior orders - number of transations made prior to the current transaction V;
		unique number of orders - number of distinct products/category? combinations per ticket V; 
		avg days since prior transaction - average number of days since a customer made a purchase V;
		avg basket size - average number of categories in each transaction;
		last basket size - number of categories in the last transaction; 
		number of categories only bought once - number of categories bought only once by a customer;
		reordered categories by a customer - number of categories reordered by a customer (derived feature: 2ª-8ª),
		--
		mode; 
		1st quartil; 
		median;
		3rd quartil
		--
		
	- category features 
		total number of categories bought - total number of times each category was purchased V;
		number of customers who bought a category - total number of customers (distinct) who of bought a category V;
		--
		mode 
		1st quartil 
		median 3rd 
		quartil of dow for a category;
		--
		
	- customer-category features
		customers who bought only one time - if a customer bought only one time from a category - 1, otherwise - 0;
		number of reorders of a customer for a category - total number of times each category was reordered by a customer; 
		avg days since a customer bought from a category - average number of days since the last transaction that included that category; 
		days since a customer bought from a category - number of days since the last transaction that included that category;
		--
		mode 
		1st quartil 
		median 
		3rd quartil of dow of a customer for a category

- 2nd Part - 
Apply feature selection before tensor flow and compare the results.
	Filter methods: Correlations

- Normalization: min-max normalization vs standardization (normal distribution approach)
- Log transformation

- Label: 1 if a customer bought a category in the last x months else 0

- Training-validation-test split

- Training models, with feature selection (tensorflow evaluates importance of features for predicting the target variable) and hyperparameter tuning. Check if features with high computational cost actually improve well the model’s predictability power.
