I have this major project in my master's degree, and I need your help understanding what I should do! Now, this is not a thesis, it's a project with a very big portuguese company, SONAE MC, more specifically with one of its brands, Continente. So, I have a dataset with several transactions, where the instances are individual items bought in a given order. This product has a subcategory, category, brand, and other columns. The goal of this project is to first find the top20 categories for a given customer, and the company wants a supervised learning approach. In other words, and in portuguese: "1.Conjunto de 20 ofertas relevantes por cliente, numa lógica de 
recompensa (ofertas em que o cliente já tenha realizado compras nos 
últimos 12 meses) | Para cada uma das ofertas finais deve ser definida a oportunidade 
primordial do cliente: aumento de gasto, frequência ou variedade". So, for example, the company might want to increase their revenue by motivating the customer to by from a certain category for them to ear a certain amount of money to spend with their card, or motivate them to by from a different category or brand to earn the same benefit. Now, to solve this problem I thought about frequent pattern mining (FPM), and here the approach would be by frequency, however they want a supervised approach. What do you think about this? Is there a way to use FPM as well as supervised learning in this problem? How would you solve this?
It sounds like a challenging and interesting project! While frequent pattern mining (FPM) can be useful in identifying patterns and associations in the data, it may not be the most suitable approach for the specific task you described.

Instead, a supervised learning approach can be more appropriate, as it allows you to train a model to predict which categories are most likely to be relevant to a specific customer based on their purchase history.

To get started, you could approach the problem as a classification task, where the input is a customer's transaction history and the output is a set of top 20 relevant categories. You could use various machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks to build your model.

To train your model, you'll need to label your data with the appropriate categories for each customer. You could use a set of pre-defined categories or create your own based on the available data. Once you have labeled data, you can split it into a training and testing set and use various performance metrics to evaluate your model.

Finally, to address the second part of the problem, you could use a technique called "opportunity identification" to determine the primary opportunity for each customer. This involves identifying the specific behavior that the company wants to incentivize, such as increasing spending, frequency, or variety, and then using your model's predictions to determine the most relevant categories for each opportunity.

Overall, a supervised learning approach can be a powerful way to identify the most relevant categories for each customer and determine the best opportunities for incentivizing behavior. Good luck with your project!


Luís Henriques:

But what would the label look like? It's true that each transaction has the category associated, however here we want a set of categories, not only just one!


ChatGPT:

You're right, apologies for the oversight. Since you're trying to predict a set of top 20 categories for each customer, this is actually a multi-label classification problem, where each instance (i.e., customer) can be associated with multiple labels (i.e., categories).

To create your training data, you would need to first group the transactions by customer and extract the categories associated with each transaction. Then, for each customer, you would create a binary vector that encodes whether or not they have purchased each category within a certain timeframe (e.g., the past 12 months). This would result in a matrix where each row represents a customer and each column represents a category, with the elements of the matrix being either 0 or 1.

Once you have your labeled data in this format, you can train a multi-label classification model, such as a multi-label decision tree or a multi-label neural network, to predict the top 20 categories for each customer. The output of the model would be a binary vector indicating which of the categories the model predicts are most relevant for that particular customer.

To determine the opportunity associated with each category, you could use association rule mining techniques, such as Apriori or FP-Growth, to identify which categories are associated with increases in spending, frequency, or variety. You could then map the predicted categories from your model to the appropriate opportunity based on these association rules.

I hope this helps clarify the approach!


Luís Henriques:

Ok, I believe that helped! But explain more in detail the last step... I thought association rule mining was only associated with frequent patters... How can my team use association rule mining to determine the proper categories based on the appropriate opportunity (frequency, variety, or increases in spending)?


ChatGPT:

You're correct that association rule mining is often used for finding frequent patterns in data, but it can also be used to discover associations between different attributes in the data. In this case, we can use it to discover which categories are associated with each of the three opportunities you mentioned: frequency, variety, and increases in spending.

The general idea is to identify sets of categories that are frequently purchased together, and then look for associations between those sets and the three opportunities. For example, if customers who buy items from the "Snacks" and "Soft Drinks" categories tend to have a higher spending frequency, we could identify those two categories as being associated with the "Frequency" opportunity.

Here are the general steps to perform association rule mining to identify which categories are associated with each opportunity:

Preprocess the data: This step involves cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for association rule mining. In your case, this might involve removing outliers, converting the data to the appropriate format, and selecting the appropriate time frame for the analysis.

Identify frequent itemsets: Next, we use an algorithm like Apriori or FP-Growth to identify sets of categories that are frequently purchased together. This step will give us a list of frequent itemsets, each of which represents a set of categories that are often purchased together.

Compute association rules: Once we have identified the frequent itemsets, we can use them to generate association rules that describe the relationships between different sets of categories and the three opportunities. For example, an association rule might state that customers who purchase items from the "Frozen Foods" and "Ice Cream" categories tend to have a higher spending frequency.

Evaluate the association rules: Finally, we evaluate the association rules to determine which categories are associated with each opportunity. We might do this by selecting the rules that have the highest support or confidence, or by using a statistical test like the chi-squared test to determine which rules are most significant.

Once we have identified which categories are associated with each opportunity, we can use this information to map the predicted categories from the multi-label classification model to the appropriate opportunity. For example, if the model predicts that a customer is likely to purchase items from the "Snacks" and "Soft Drinks" categories, we can map those categories to the "Frequency" opportunity based on the association rule that we discovered earlier.

I hope this helps clarify the process!
